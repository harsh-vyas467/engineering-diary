‚úÖ Work Done

* Implemented the audit logs feature for the Employee Management System.
* Audit data is now being stored in MongoDB, capturing:
    - What changes were made (create, update, delete).
    - Who made the changes (currently only a system user; multi-user support coming later).
* Verified that the audit logging functionality is working as expected.

üõ†Ô∏è Current Project Stack & Features Overview

* Spring Boot backend with full CRUD functionality for managing employee data.
* PostgreSQL used as the primary database for employee records.
* MongoDB used for storing audit trail logs.
* FlywayDB integrated to maintain schema versioning and track history in Git.
* JpaRepository auto schema creation disabled to avoid schema changes in production environments.
* AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) used for clean and centralized logging.
* DTO pattern implemented with MapStruct for mapping between entities and DTOs.
* Used annotations such as @JsonProperty for clean JSON serialization.
* Constructor injection preferred over @Autowired, using Lombok annotations like @AllArgsConstructor and @RequiredArgsConstructor.
